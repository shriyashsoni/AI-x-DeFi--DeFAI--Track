### **ðŸ“œ DeFAI: AI-Powered DeFi Credit & Loan System**
ðŸš€ **Built for Flare x Google Verifiable AI Hackathon**  

#### **ðŸ”— Overview**
DeFAI is a **decentralized, AI-powered credit scoring and loan system** that leverages smart contracts to provide verifiable loans on the blockchain. It integrates **Chainlink oracles** for real-time price feeds and stablecoin transactions, ensuring a transparent and trustless lending system.

## **ðŸ“œ Smart Contract Overview**
### **ðŸ’° Loan Contract (`DeFiAICreditSystem.sol`)**
Handles loan issuance, repayments, and credit score tracking.
```solidity
function requestLoan(uint256 amount) public;
function repayLoan(uint256 index) public;
function getCreditScore(address user) public view returns (uint256);
```
